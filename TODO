- package bouwer correctly: http://www.scotttorborg.com/python-packaging/everything.html

- builder mesh is hiding the error in the python back trace... we should fix this. put the
  original Bouwfile in the backtrace!

- when unknown dependency, the builder execution should be postponed as late as possible, such 
  that the builder has a chance to generate & execute. If the unknown dependency never comes, its an error!

- TODO: what if the developer wishes to override CC generic configuration?
  e.g. set the include path to './myincludes' for *ALL* compilers?

    --> make a generic ConfigString for this, e.g. ConfigString('INCLUDES', default = '')

  --> he must add it to CC somehow...
    --> perhaps we can let the Object() use CC's keywords too!

- implement lazy plugin loading
  --> only load plugin builders, when they are called, such that not ALL plugins
      are loaded at startup, when they aren't needed!
  --> how much time do we save?

- implement implicit C header dependency scanner please!
    --> watch out for performance here!
    --> maybe caching?

- when overriding, the user may want to only append config keys, or make them unmodifyable.
  For this, we need indirection support for keywords in Config's. E.g.:

  # This appends the gcc cflags and linker flags for this override
  ConfigBool('GCC',
              _cflags  = '-Wall -Werror',
              _ldflags = '-static'
  )
  
  # Sometimes the user may want to mark certain keywords as unmodifyable from the configuration plugins.
  # for example, the user should never need to change the include path:
  ConfigBool('GCC',
              _cflags   = '-Wall -Werror',
              _ldflags  = '-static',
              __incpath = 'includes'
  )

  # To make a whole configuration item unmodifyable, simply mark it's title read-only:
  ConfigBool('FREEBSD',
              __title = 'FreeBSD operating system',
              help = 'This item is True when FreeBSD is detected',
              foo  = True,
              bar  = 123,
  )

  # To have both append and read-only, just put three _'s:
  ConfigBool('GCC',
              ___cflags = '-Wall',
              help = 'These GCC flags are appended and cannot be changed'
  )

- UseLibrary should look in the ActionTree to fill in -L <path>
    --> if two libraries with the same name, then solve like this:
        library/sub/path/libfoo.a
        library/other/path/libfoo.a
        UseLibrary(conf.FOO, ['sub/path/libfoo', 'libbar'])

    --> add a config option to also add -I or -isystem for libraries, ie:
        BoolConfig('GCC',
                    libinc = '.')

        this will make a -I to the directory of the library itself.
        if the user has like a 'include/' dir for every source lib dir, then:
        
        BoolConfig('GCC',
                    libinc = 'include')

- make a builder for sphinx

- implement simple cherrypy frontend
    --> do this with threading

- see if we could support interpolation in keywords, e.g.:
    Config('GCC', 'TARGET',
            ldscript = 'architecture/$ARCH/kernel.ld')

- implement daemon mode

- implement a --pretend mode, which doesn't really execute commands

- implement on-the-fly action generation from Workers, to support source generators

- support python 2.6.1 for MacOSX?

- fix error messages in plugins, especially on unknown attributes:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/home/fox/Repositories/Bouwer.git/source/bouwer/config.py", line 159, in __getattr__
          return self.__dict__[name]

- also depend on the .bouwconf/Configuration changes for builders!
    --> we may need to cache all Action command's... i.e. if the command changed, rebuild
    --> but then what about python functions?
    --> or, timestamp each Config object also

- implement plugin.invoke('output', ...)

- test bouwer on existing projects
    - replace its build system completely with bouwer, e.g. apache or gcc or whatever
    - final test is the linux kernel

- test bouwer on all interesting operating systems and compilers and projects
    --> we need integration software, e.g. jenkins-ci.org

- implement CheckHeader, CheckLibrary, CheckCompiler

- localizable configuration text/titles?
- status output modules:
    + verbose full command output:    gcc -o foo.o foo.c -Wall
    +/- fancified short command output: CC  foo.c
    + progress bar output:            [#######----------------] 33%
    + quiet output:
    + logfile output: build.log
- configuration frontends:
    + stdio fgets
    - curses menuconfig
    - qt4 graphical gui
    - html web based frontend
- http frontend for build output too.
    - e.g. an http daemon mode plugin, which has a config + output plugin
- IDE integration, e.g. eclipse
- builders
- pre/post builder hook
    - e.g. static code checks for C programs, which must happen on every invocation of e.g. the Object() builder
    - check must also happen on header files plz!
- configuration items
    +/- json persistency
