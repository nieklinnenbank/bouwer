+ only rescan Bouwconfig files if there is no .bouwconf available pls.

- use the python logging module instead of self.args.verbose!

- also decide() against the .bouwconf/Configuration!

- use a Bus pub/sub a-like system for events? this may also be handy for the plugins.

- Checking for valid CC configuration must happen in a PREBUILD work queue, in parallel
    --> do this in a detect() function of the Object() builder plz
- There can also be a POSTBUILD work queue for post processing
- i.e. the work queues must have different levels or so

- add testoob test cases for bouwer?

- localizable configuration text/titles?
+ loadable plugins/modules
- status output modules:
    - verbose full command output:    gcc -o foo.o foo.c -Wall
    - fancified short command output: CC  foo.c
    - progress bar output:            [#######----------------] 33%
    - quiet output:
    - logfile output: build.log
- configuration frontends:
    - stdio fgets
    - curses menuconfig
    - qt4 graphical gui
    - html web based frontend
- http frontend for build output too.
    - e.g. an http daemon mode plugin, which has a config + output plugin
- IDE integration, e.g. eclipse
- builders
- pre/post builder hook
    - e.g. static code checks for C programs, which must happen on every invocation of e.g. the Object() builder
    - check must also happen on header files plz!
- configuration items
    +/- json persistency
